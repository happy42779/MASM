# MASM

Longing to learn MASM32, I tried to find if there's any IDE available.
I found some, like MASMPlus, RadAsm, WinAsm Studio, Easy code...
Almost all of them have code completion feature, yet due to the time they were released, 
the way it helps the code completion is not that good.

I like sublime text very much, but it's not that ideal to use sublime as the code completion in sublime(now i can inplement) is only by 
in-built completion feature by sublime & snippets.
I want to learn writing a addin for either sublime or one of the IDEs memtioned above. 
Then either sublime becomes smarter like a IDE or the IDEs becomes flexible.
